```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

set.seed(1)
```

## writing my first function !!

as an example, here is a z-score computation:

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(n = 25, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

not i'll write a function to do this

```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("x needs to be numeric")
  }
  
  if (length(x) < 5) {
    stop("you need at least five numbers to compute the z score")
  }
  
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}

z_scores(x = x_vec)
```

() will have the function and {} will hold what it should do


does this always work?

```{r, error = TRUE}

z_scores(x = 3)
# you cant compute the sd with just one numbers
z_scores(x = c("my", "name", "is", "Jeff"))
# no because these are characters..

```


## A new function!

```{r}
mean_and_sd = function(x) {
  
  mean_x = mean(x)
  sd_x = sd(x)
  
  out_df = 
    tibble(
      mean = mean_x,
      sd = sd_x
      )
  
  return(out_df)
}

mean_and_sd(x_vec)
```

## Check stuff using a simulation:

```{r}
sim_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(30, 10, 5)
  )

sim_df |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x)
  )
```


Simulation function to check sample mean and sd

```{r, error= TRUE}
sim_mean_sd = function(samp_size, true_mean, true_sd) {
  
  sim_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm(samp_size, true_mean, true_sd)
  )

out_df = 
  sim_df |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(x),
    sd = sd(x)
  )

return(out_df)
}

sim_mean_sd(samp_size = 3000, true_mean = 4, true_sd = .12)
# order doesnt matter in there

sim_mean_sd(30, 16, 2)
# this will follow the order as above

#you can also set default values up on the first line of this chunk. If you do this, the following will work (because it will assume the true mean and sd:

sim_mean_sd(30)

```
